For an in-depth description, check out the report.

General Guidelines:
- It is recommended that you run the code on Google Colab (here). You might face installation issues otherwise.
- The features (similarity) were calculated for the dataset: [Data for Automatic Short Answer Grading](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/downloads.html#saga). It took about an hour to run, so that section wasn't included in the report.
- The Model is well suited for short answer grading, it does not work well on long texts.
