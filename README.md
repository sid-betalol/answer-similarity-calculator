For an in-depth description, check out the [report](https://github.com/sid-betalol/answer-similarity-calculator/blob/main/Report.pdf).

Here is a quick look at the approach:

![Model approach](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62656543/177000238-f12b4f4f-14ac-4b22-b41a-dd9c8a2ccecd.PNG)

General Guidelines:
- It is recommended that you run the code on Google Colab [(here)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C1r7G01RqFne-9XDtbY95K9ud6xiKKM8?usp=sharing). You might face installation issues otherwise.
- The features (similarity) were calculated for the dataset: [Data for Automatic Short Answer Grading](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/downloads.html#saga). It took about an hour to run, so that section wasn't included in the report.
- The Model is well suited for short answer grading, it does not work well on long texts.
